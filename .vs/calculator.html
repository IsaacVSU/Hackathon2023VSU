              <h2 class="What-is-a-loan">What is a Loan?</h2>
              <p class="What-is-a-loan">A loan is a commitment. Whether your loan lasts only two years or stretches into the next 15, you must make a conscious effort to ensure you make your monthly payments. 
                Knowing how much you have to set aside means you’re less likely to miss payments once you begin repayments.</p>

              <div class="box-inner">
                <h3 class="principal">Principal:</h3>
                <p class="principal">The amount you borrow from your lender is the principal. It is the basis of any kind of loan. 
                  For example, if you borrow $20,000 for a personal loan, your principal is $20,000.</p>
          
                <h3 class="loan-term">Loan Term:</h3>
                <p class="loan-term">The loan term is how long your lender allows you to repay your loan. Different loans have varying loan terms. 
                  They can be as short as one or two years for a personal loan, while mortgages can run for 15 or 30 years.</p>
          
                <h3 class="interset-rate">Interest Rate:</h3>
                <p class="interset-rate">A lender charges an amount for lending you the money you need — that's your interest rate. It's often a percentage of how much you borrow and is affected by several factors, including your credit score. 
                  You'll spend more per month with a higher interest rate.</p>
