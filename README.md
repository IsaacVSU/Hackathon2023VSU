There is a need to improve access to updated pricing information (e.g., loan rates, deposit rates, 	housing rates). Homebuyers have a hard time finding out this information, so it makes it harder for them to purchase homes. 
Develop a tool that can provide homeowners with the information needed to find the best priced house and the best realtor and mortgage firm in an area of choice. The tool should compare pricing and changes within trends, and predict possible surges or dips.
